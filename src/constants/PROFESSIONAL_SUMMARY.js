/**
 * The plain language thing I'm trying to get to the recruiter is "Hey I'm a software engineer that has saved my company millions, I've been promoted to a senior level and tasked at an architectural and SME position within my first 2 years because I'm an avid learner, and love doing cool shit with software. I know how to take a requirements document. Build the entire thing, then integrate back into your organization, because I don't just know how to style a page, implement parralel processing, or ease back pressure through database hacks and automate your business processing flow I can wire it all together, and make it a part of your organization while doing it in the cloud or with a mindset that you'll be going there some day. So hire me for your cloud work or systems work I'll make it stronger, more modern, more scalable, and pay down your technical debt with every sprint, ticket, and project you want to implement".
